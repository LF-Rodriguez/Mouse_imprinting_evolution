## Hisat2Tophat

This python script adds the HI tag to an alignment file in SAM format generated by Hisat2.
The HI tag denotes the query hit index of the alignment, which indicates the relative position
of the alignment in the SAM file with respect to the other alignments of the same read.

Hisat2Tophat takes two arguments, the first is the input SAM file, and the second
is the name for the output file.

`python hisat2Tophat.py input.sam output.sam`
